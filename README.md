## Project-ESP32-SenseData-1ButtonSendEmergency

# Summary 
 
We receive the Data sensed by the Arduino on pin A1 and send it through the software serial to the ESP32 (server), the ESP32 connected to the wifi and posting this info on the local host server address, this data (pin A1 reading) is displayed on the local webpage (client).
The local webpage contains an emergency button, this is not a functional button.  

 
## This repo includes:
 - A firmware for an Adrduino uno that was coded on Arduino IDE
 - A firmware for an ESP32 that was coded on Arduino IDE
 - The index.html file is for coding a webpage that is displayed on the local host server address
 - The python file is also running on the local host and the local port
